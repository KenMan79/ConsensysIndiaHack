# ConsensysIndiaHack

## A project to store credit scores on blockchain.
## Motivation:-
Students in india doesn,t have much resources to get instant loan as students don,t have a credit score.We tried to bridge the gap
between students and micro lenders.
This solution consists of two roles, one is lender and one is credit seeker.Any lender can connect with our smart contract via our api.
In this app student will create a civic id and submit his/her kyc documents,social media accounts and college id.Any lender can verify
their documents and give them a credit score.Initial credit score is on the basis of social score of student.
Lender can specify the interest rate,penalty rate.Lender is also verified by manager of the smart contract.No one can simply become the
lender they need to register first in the smart contract.


## Prequisites:-
Civic mobile app
